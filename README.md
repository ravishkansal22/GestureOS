# GestureOS
GestureOS is an AI-powered gesture-controlled desktop system that enables users to interact with their computer using hand gestures instead of traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard. It uses computer vision and real-time hand tracking to recognize gestures and convert into system commands, providing a touchless user experience.
